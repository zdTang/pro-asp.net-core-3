# Action Filter Approach Three
  override filter methods within Controller directly!
  Two methods can be overrided.  one will run before invoking Action. Another will run after invoking Action
  Can override either methods or both of them.

# Exception Filter
  Try the code, very beautiful, can handle the Exception!
# Manage the Filter Lifecycle

# Using DI scope to manage Filter Lifecycles
  1. what is scope?
  2. AddScoped() means one scope only create one instance.
  3. In the second screen, even through I used 3 browsers, but they all come from the same machine, the requests are same.   same IP..

# Global filter
  Notice the "HttpsOnly" filter will generate a Result,  which will be filtered by "GuidResponse" result filter.  so that need to comment "GuidResponse"

# Change the Filter Order
  1. Use "Order" property  -1,0,1,2,3  sequential order
  2. the Attribute must inherit "IOrderedFilter" interface
